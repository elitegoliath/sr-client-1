# sr-client-1
Ads for some SR client - theoretical git repo

# Clients
Each client gets its own repo. This repo is a dummy client.

# Jobs
Jobs are split out into their own branches so that when you pull down assets to work on, you get only what you need.

There are many ways these branches can be broken down. For this test, I will use 2 different approaches.

## Approach 1
Branches are split by Job #. 

```
Job1
    |____Size1
        |____OptionA
        |____OptionB
    |____Size 2
        |____OptionA
        |____OptionB
```
